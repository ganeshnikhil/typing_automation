## Description

This Python script automates the process of taking a screenshot, extracting text from the screenshot, and simulating keyboard input to type the extracted text. It can be used for various automation tasks and simplifies the process of copying text from images to your system.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following Python packages installed:

- `mss` (version 6.0.0)

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

- **Screenshot Capture:** Utilizes the `mss` library to capture a screenshot of a specified area on the screen.

- **Text Extraction:** Extracts text from the captured screenshot using image processing techniques and Tesseract OCR (via `pytesseract`).

- **Keyboard Input:** Simulates keyboard input using the `keyboard` library to type the extracted text.

## Usage
